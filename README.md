This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players to take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid with "X" or "O". The game declares a winner when three marks are aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

The game is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The JavaScript handles the game logic, including tracking turns, detecting wins, and resetting the board for a new game. The interface includes a restart button to easily reset the game state, and the winning line is highlighted when a player wins. Basic feedback is displayed to indicate the winner or if the game ends in a draw.
